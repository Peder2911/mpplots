look at the association between substitution of illicit crops and support for
the peace process. I think we should set it up as a regression where you
regress support for the peace process (P34 or P35) on the relevant illicit
crops variables (abbey steele (Guest), Michael Lee Weintraub (Guest), Helga
Malmin Binningsb√∏ or Marianne Dahl, question numbers please) as well as a
minimal set of standard controls, let's do age, gender, and PDET fixed effects.
If you can set that up as a simple regression and then, if the association is
significant, simulate and graph the effect?

(2)
something that looks at the association between support for the peace accord
(both if voted for and the support variable) vs support for implementation.
Here they want to look at the 'off diagonal' ones, i.e. those that did NOT like
the agreement but who now nevertheless support the implementation. Are there
many of these, if yes where are they (maybe map?), can we say anything about
their profiles (in terms of other background characteristics)?
