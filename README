The ./docs folder contains codebook sheets used to annotate the plots. The
annotations (variable names / value mappings) gathered from this folder are
masked in some cases by "hand-defined" values in the ./docs/mask.json file.
The mappings gleamed from the raw codebook are cached in the ./cache folder.

The ./raw folder contains the raw dataset.
